# Create an R Notebook  (A reproducible, literate code script)
# From the menubar:  File > New File > R Notebook      # Remember this should be done WITHIN an R Project to ensure reproducibility
# Inside the newly opened R Notebook, see/read the reminder help information found in the first twenty lines.
# execute the code chunk consisting of the function `plot()` on the object `cars`
# 
# PREVIEW the document:  click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file.

# Add a code chunk
# import the `cars2` CSV file:  cars2 <- readr::read_csv("data/cars2.csv")
# Show a preview of the `cars2` data frame in:   cars2


# Add a code chunk  AT THE TOP of your R Notebook
# Load the tidyverse library:  library(tidyverse)


# Add a code chunk at the bottom
# Paste at least one of the visualizations commands 
# e.g.:  starwars %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + geom_histogram()


# Previously you downloaded and unzipped the intro2r code repo from GitHub
