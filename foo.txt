## Your TURN -- Excercise 00

Create a new R Notebook and add some code to load a library, import some CSV data, and view the imported data frame.  In this exercise you will also practice separated prose from code chunks to begin implementing literate coding.

2. IMPORTANT:  click the _open in browser_ button at the top of that preview page
3. Now scroll down to the bottom of that document and follow the DIRECTIONS section.

### DIRECTIONS

1. Create an R Notebook  (A reproducible, literate code script)

    - From the menubar:  `File > New File > R Notebook`      
    - Remember this should be done WITHIN an R Project to ensure reproducibility.
    - Inside the newly opened R Notebook, see/read the reminder help information found in the first twenty lines.
    - Execute the code chunk consisting of the function `plot()` on the object `cars`
 
2. Save the file as:  hello_world.Rmd

    - PREVIEW the document:  click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file.
    - You can delete lines 5-19 and modify lines 2 & 3, but you might want to keep that useful information for the moment 
    
        - See Also, [basic YAML header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)

3. Add a code chunk AT THE TOP of your `hello_world.Rmd` Notebook -- approximately line 6 --, then load the tidyverse library package.  Now shift to the bottom and add a code chunk for each question...
4. Import the `cars2` CSV file and asign it to the object name, `cars2`
5. View the `cars2` data frame, or Tibble as it's know in Tidyverse language.
6. Display the on-board `starwars` data frame.  It's available after you loaded the `tidyverse` package in step 3
7. Add a code chunk and run some basic visualizations

    - Paste at least one line from the code below.  This will craete a visualizations of some _Star Wars_ characters' features and traits

```
starwars %>% ggplot(aes(height)) + geom_histogram()
starwars %>% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data = starwars %>% filter(mass < 500), aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point()
starwars %>% ggplot(aes(hair_color)) + geom_bar()
starwars %>% ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(hair_color))) + geom_bar()
starwars %>% ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(hair_color))) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Hair Color Frequency of Star Wars Characters")
```
